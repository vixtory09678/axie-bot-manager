THE FOLLOWING CALLS TAKE AN AUTHENTICATION TOKEN TO ACCESS THEM. THIS IS WHAT THE CALL WOULD LOOK LIKE IN PYTHON:

```python
def getPlayer(token, address):
    url = "https://game-api.axie.technology/player/" + address
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token
    }

    response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)
    return response.text
```
